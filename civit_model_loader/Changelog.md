## 2025-10-14 - Fix Image Conversion Download Polling Issue

### Fixed
- **Frontend: Image conversion download polling continues after completion**
  - Added `isDownloading` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous downloads
  - Modified polling logic to check `!isDownloading` before triggering download
  - Set `isDownloading = true` immediately when starting download to block subsequent attempts
  - Set `pollingInterval = null` after `clearInterval()` for defensive cleanup
  - Applied fix to failed and error handlers as well for consistency
  
### Technical Details
The issue occurred because `clearInterval()` only prevents future ticks from being scheduled, but does not stop async functions that are already executing. When the conversion completed, multiple polling ticks could:
1. Each see `status.status === "completed"`
2. Each call `clearInterval()` (ineffective for already-running ticks)
3. Each call `downloadCompletedConversion()` 
4. Result in multiple binary blob downloads that blocked browser file save

The fix uses an `isDownloading` flag as a mutex to ensure only the first completion handler proceeds with the download.

### Files Modified
- `civit_model_loader/static/app.js:195-247` - Added flag and updated polling logic
